## 📋 Overview

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring a customized Arch Linux desktop environment. It includes configurations for tools like bspwm, zsh, fish, neovim, rofi, and more, along with a script to automate installation, backup existing configs, and set up dependencies. The setup is designed to be lightweight, modern, and highly customizable.

### ✨ Features
- Window Manager: BSPWM with Polybar and SXHKD for a minimal and efficient desktop.
- Shell: Zsh and Fish with custom themes (Starship prompt).
- Editor: Neovim with LunarVim and custom configurations.
- Tools: Rofi, Alacritty, Kitty, Eww, MPD, and more.
- Fonts: SFMono Nerd Font for a clean and ligaturized look.
- Backup: Automatically backs up existing configurations to ~/.RiceBackup.
- Theming: Custom themes for KDE, Firefox, Telegram, and Spotify (via Spicetify).
- Dependencies: Installs all required packages via pacman and yay.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Operating System: Arch Linux or Arch-based distributions (e.g., Manjaro, EndeavourOS).
- Internet Connection: Required for downloading dependencies and cloning repositories.
- User Privileges: Run the script as a non-root user (root is needed for some package installations).
